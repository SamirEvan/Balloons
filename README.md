# Balloons
TO UNDERSTAND THE DESIGN PROCESS (WITH PICTURES), PLEASE
LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTATION PDF.

Balloons is an interactive installation born out of my team’s desire 
to create something beautiful, simple, and fun. The project is a canopy, 
much like those used for wedding photos, that is filled with multicolor 
balloons. Each quadrant of the canopy is assigned a sensor, and the sensors
each play different songs. When participants pull on the balloons, the 
sensors detect the downward motion and play music. If participants pull all 
of the balloons, all four songs are triggered, resulting in a cacophonous mix 
of audio signals that is not conventionally pleasing, but is interesting nonetheless. 
In addition to my team’s desire to create something simple and fun, we also
attempted to build an installation that would encourage participants to share their
experience via social media. We recognize that in today’s day and age, social media 
value is an important factor to consider when creating installation, because projects 
with high “trendability” encourage more participants to interact with the project and 
share their experiences.

Balloons is designed for all ages and gender identities. Participants are encouraged to 
have their picture taken with the installation by on-site photographers, or they can take 
their own pictures with their phones when there is no photographer available. To accompany
the installation and further improve its social media value, my team created stickers with
balloons and the title of the project. These stickers allow participants to carry reminders 
of their experience with our installation while helping my team market our installation with 
relative ease.
